What is a frontend dev ?
==> A person who proficient to utilise html, css and js. they have given layout by UX/UI to work on.

Now Think like 
HTML --> HTML is skeletal
CSS --> CSS is skin
JAVASCRIPT --> JAVASCRIPT is Logic/Brain


Code Editor --> VS Code

Download all image assets and create index.html file for main html Code

open index.html with liver server extension

css can be written in inline and external file link

now understand the structure of the design we have given
-> mostly it is in rectangle or container

for our purpose we have semantic tag for particular part of design

now take look at navbar
 we have two part or rectangles
    1. it consist of three part : logo, divider and Home link --> we will create class called header-left
    2. it consist of four part : our food link, ingredients link,studies link and FAQ link --> we will create class called header-right in nav


now take look at main hero section
basically it comprise of heading, para/body text, CTA button and a hero image 

as the html get over then wrap all the html within class called wrap

-----
now focus on the CSS 
understand the rule set -- structure
  selector {
     property-name: value;
  }

  above structure is rule set

  
  selector : it can be element or class
  property-name: it can be property that has given to selector
  value : it can be value of the property that has given to selector

  reference class in rule-set: before class name add "."
     --> .class {
         property-name: value;
     }

  reference id in rule-set: before id name add "#"
     --> #id {
         property-name: value;
     }


margin => it will give the spacing outside around the element of html
padding => it will give the spacing inside around the element of html

to change the font we have to use google font for whole html file
-> import the embed by link in html file or import in css file
-> add the font property in rule-set
     font-family: 'font-name', default-font-name; 


now css will work on parent - children nesting

dev tools in chrome

css unit --> absolute and relative unit

z-index --> majorly stack the position according to given number -- highest number means top of all other element and lowest number means below of all other element

focus on the main content

after main content focus media queries for desktop and mobile

-----

Now Look at JAVASCRIPT
link --> script file
<script src="script.js"></script>
create all variable for closing and opening button
add eventlistener on click of opening and remove eventlistener on clicking closing 

#note: use emit to get faster
